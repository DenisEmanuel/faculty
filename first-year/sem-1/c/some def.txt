Definition 1.1. A sequence of real numbers (a real sequence) has the form
a0, a1, ..., an, ...
where an ∈ R for all n ≥ 0. Formally, a sequence of real numbers can be defined as a
function a : N → R, i.e. for each natural number n ∈ N we associate the real number
an ∈ R, called the general term of the sequence. One way to denote a sequence is
(an)n∈N, (an)n≥0, or simply (an).
In some situations, a sequence must be considered as a real function defined on the
set {n ∈ N : n ≥ n0}, where n0 ∈ N is a fixed natural number (often called rank), in
which case the sequence will be denoted by (an)n≥n0
(take, for example, an =
1
n(n−2) ,
n ≥ 3). Sequences most often begin with n0 = 0 (for example, an = n − 1, n ≥ 0) or
n0 = 1 (an =
ln n
n+1 , n ≥ 1). Specifically, if n is a positive integer (that is, n0 = 1), then
an is called the nth term of the sequence.
By abuse of notation, it is often convenient to write ”the sequence an” instead of
”the sequence whose general term is an”.
Definition 1.2. A sequence (an)n≥0 of real numbers is called bounded if there exist
two finite numbers m, M such that
